### To activate AI simply click the button on the top right. The AI will make a move after you click on the square. The AI has three different modes, random, easy, and hard. The random chooses a random clickable square and makes a move. Easy finds the first available square to make a move. Hard has predetermined moves until the fourth move. After that it checks for a possible win, and if none found makes a random move. The predetermined moves are center square, top left, and then a counter if the player made a corner move. To achieve AI versus each other click the Skynet VS: button to ON then hit start move to chain. To break this chain simply hit the Skynet VS button again to switch it to off.
